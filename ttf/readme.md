### all of the ttf files should be used to create chinese text

the ttf files below should be found in the path: C:\Windows\Fonts

because of upload error, so you should get the ttf files by yourself. the reason of choose the several ttfs is when using ImageFont(module from PIL), they will not deviate from center, it mean we can easily calc the width and height of the text on the image
